    <h1 class="display-4 fw-bold text-body-emphasis">Monument to the Airplane</h1>
    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
    
      <p class="lead mb-4"> The 'Airplane' monument is a symbol of the courage and heroism of Soviet pilots during the Great Patriotic War. It was established in honor of the 40th anniversary of Victory in the northern part of the city of Tambov, in front of the Physics and Mathematics Lyceum No. 14.

        It serves as a testament to the patriotic initiative of the people of Tambov, who raised funds during the Great Patriotic War for the construction of airplanes. In 1943-44, over 85 million rubles were collected, which were used to build bombers and Yak-20 and Yak-9 fighters that were sent to the front. The squadrons of the 'Tambov Collective Farmer' planes, like the tank column, fought against the enemy.
        
        The project was created by Boris Arkadyevich Savenkov. He depicted the moment of a rapid ascent of the airplane, practically creating a picture of a vertical takeoff. The combat aircraft sharply rises into the sky, and the pedestal of the monument resembles the contrail of a jet plane. Since it was not possible to find a model of a wartime aircraft, a model of the supersonic interceptor fighter MiG-21 was installed instead.
        
        Around the monument, a park was created with paved paths, planted trees, shrubs, flower borders, and benches for resting. On the marble pedestal erected in the park, a metal inscription reads: 'This memorial was established in honor of the immortal combat and labor contribution of the people of Tambov to the heroic victory of the Soviet people during the Great Patriotic War on May 9, 1985.'
        
        During the war, the Tambov region made a significant contribution to the training of pilots, aviation engineers, and mechanics. In the pre-war years, an aviation school of the Civil Air Fleet operated in Tambov. At the beginning of the war, another school for pilot training was opened. 84 graduates of these schools became Heroes of the Soviet Union during the Great Patriotic War. In 1954, the Tambov Aviation School of the Civil Fleet was reorganized into the Higher Military Aviation School of Pilots named after M. M. Raskova.
        
        The Tambov Higher Military Aviation Engineering Red Banner School named after F. E. Dzerzhinsky made a worthy contribution to the victory over fascist Germany, training personnel for front-line airfields. On May 11, 1944, this school was awarded the Order of Lenin and the Honorary Banner of the Central Committee of the Komsomol.
        
        Victory Park is very popular among the residents of Tambov. During state holidays, mass public celebrations are organized in the park, creative groups perform, and fireworks and salutes are held.

    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
      <p class="lead mb-4"> The monument to the veteran-victor was unveiled in 2010. It celebrates the end of military actions in 1945 and symbolizes the connection between times and generations. The sculpture is located in Tambov in Victory Park.

        The composition features an elderly soldier holding a small girl in his arms. He is sitting on a bench and gazing into the distance. Various medals, including the "For the Capture of Berlin," are depicted on his chest.
        
        The monument is entirely made of bronze, with a granite base. There is a seating area next to the grandfather, which creates a sense of involvement. The authors' intention is to draw attention to those fighters who still live among us. They need the help and attention of their grandchildren. In this work, the past and the future are intertwined.
        
        A distinctive feature of the sculpture is its prototype, Ivan Stepanovich Odarchenko. He was a private in the guards and participated in the liberation of Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. He had previously posed for the monument "Warrior-Liberator" in Germany, which became a symbol of the courage of soldiers.
        
        The project was developed by V. Kulaev and V. Paramonov, with representatives of the local administration as its initiators.

      <p class="lead mb-4"> Stepan Nikolayevich Perkalsky, commander of the 322nd Rifle Division of the 60th Army of the Voronezh Front, displayed heroism during the operation to liberate the Kursk region from Nazi invaders. Under his command, 76 settlements were liberated. His division was the first to enter the city of Kursk and completely clear it of Germans. On February 8, 1943, while leading the soldiers of the 1089th Rifle Regiment into an attack on Yamskaya Gora Street in Kursk (now named after him), Lieutenant Colonel Perkalsky was mortally wounded and died in a medical station. He was posthumously awarded the rank of Colonel and the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.
